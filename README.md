- To run the server i have used the tools to run java project that code editor (vs code)
provides.

- Once the server is started, run in a terminal the follow command: "netcat localhost 8000".
And then the user is connected. We need to start one terminal for every user we want to connect in the 
server. Then we can use the follow commands as a user:

 1. /nick {new name}
 2. /list
 3. /join {room name}
 4. /exit 
 
 To send messages to the other users in the chat room we need to join to some room.
